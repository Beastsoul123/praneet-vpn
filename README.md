Project Name: Praneet-VPN

Vision: Create a secure and reliable Virtual Private Network (VPN) solution using Python, leveraging the cryptography library for encryption and decryption. This project aims to provide a basic framework for establishing a secure connection between a client and a server, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of data exchanged.

Features:

Secure Data Transfer: Encrypts and decrypts data using AES-256-CBC algorithm, ensuring confidentiality and integrity of data.

Server-Client Architecture: Establishes a connection between a server and multiple clients, allowing for secure communication.

Authentication: Uses a shared secret key for encryption and decryption, providing a basic level of authentication.

Error Handling: Implements basic error handling for socket connections and data transfer.


Future Scope:

User Authentication: Implement user authentication using username/password or certificate-based authentication.

Key Exchange: Implement a secure key exchange protocol, such as Diffie-Hellman or Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman.

Traffic Encryption: Encrypt all traffic between the client and server, including metadata.

Scalability: Improve the server architecture to handle a large number of concurrent connections.

Security Auditing: Perform regular security audits to identify vulnerabilities and improve the overall security posture.

Multi-Platform Support: Develop clients for various platforms, including Windows, macOS, and mobile devices.

Graphical User Interface: Create a user-friendly GUI for the client and server, making it easier to use and manage.


Current Limitations:

Shared Secret Key: Uses a hardcoded shared secret key, which is not secure in a production environment.

Limited Error Handling: Error handling is basic and may not cover all possible scenarios.

No User Authentication: Does not implement user authentication, which is a critical security feature.
